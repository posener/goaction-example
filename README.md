# Goaction Example

an example of the simplest goaction sctipt.

Notice that the only non-generated file is [./main.go](./main.go).
The generated files were generated using Github action [./github/workflows/goaction.yml](./github/workflows/goaction.yml).

The [./main.go](./main.go) is the only non-generated file and is a simple Go script, and can be run with:

```go
$ go run .
```

The [./action.yml](./action.yml) is autogenerated and contains the action definition. Notice that the flag from the
program below appears as the input for the Github action. You can see the action in-action in the
[action page](https://github.com/posener/goaction-example/actions?query=workflow%3A.github%2Fworkflows%2Fgoaction.yml).

The [./Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) is autogenerated and will also run the [./main.go](./main.go) sctipt. You can build and run it
with docker, even if you don't have Go installed on your machine:

```go
$ docker build -t goaction-example .
$ docker run --rm goaction-example
```

This is the simplest program possible. Goaction also provides a library that helps writing Github
action scripts easily.
